    "text": "My experience in FRC During my time in the FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition), I served as both a team leader and a key contributor in engineering and programming. As a robot driver and engineer, I helped my team achieve significant results, including finishing as the runner-up in the 2019 Sydney regional and reaching the top four in the 2018 Shanghai and 2017 Pittsburgh competitions. Apart from these, I also successfully established a new team during the pandemic, recruited members, and coordinated our efforts despite the challenges of not being able to compete since there were no games that year. This experience honed my leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, as I collaborated closely with my team to tackle technical challenges."

    "text": "I am a dedicated student at the University of Toronto, double majoring in math & statistics. My passion for technology stems from early participation in STEM competitions and has grown through hands-on experiences like leading an FRC Robotics team and dismantling tech products to understand their inner workings. Beyond academics, I enjoy fitness and photography, and I have learned the value of teamwork through basketball."
